# simpl-schema CHANGELOG

## 0.3.2

Bump dependencies to fix `messages` issues

## 0.3.1

- When calling `pick` or `omit`, the `messageBox` and all original `SimpleSchema` constructor options are now properly kept. (Thanks @plumpudding)
- Fixed #80 (Thanks @jasonphillips)
- `getQuickTypeForKey` may now return additional strings "object" or "objectArray"
- Fix erroneous "Found both autoValue and defaultValue" warning (Thanks @SachaG)
- Fix passing of clean options when extending
- Other fixes to extending logic

## 0.3.0

- Added human-friendly `message` to each validation error in the `details` array on a thrown ClientError (thanks @unknown4unnamed)
- Fixed isInteger error on IE11 (thanks @lmachens)
- Switched to duck typing for `SimpleSchema` instanceof checks to fix failures due to multiple instances of the package (thanks @dpankros)
- Fixed multiple calls to `messages` for different schemas from affecting the other schemas (thanks @Josh-ES)

## 0.2.3

- Add missing deep-extend dependency

## 0.2.2

- Fixed Meteor Tracker reactivity

## 0.2.1

- It is no longer considered a validation error when a key within $unset is not defined in the schema.

## 0.2.0

- Added `ssInstance.getQuickTypeForKey(key)`
- Added `ssInstance.getObjectSchema(key)`

## 0.1.1

- Improved error for missing `type` property
- Use _.contains instead of Array.includes to fix some compatibility issues (thanks @DerekTBrown)
- Various documentation and test fixes

## 0.1.0

- Added `ssInstance.getAllowedValuesForKey(key)`

## 0.0.4

- Removed the `babel-polyfill` dependency. It may not cause problems, but to be safe you'll want to be sure that your app depends on and imports `babel-polyfill` or some other ES2015 polyfill package.
- `this.validationContext` is now available in all custom validator functions (thanks @yanickrochon)
- You can now call `SimpleSchema.setDefaultMessages(messages)`, passing in the same object you would pass to the `MessageBox` constructor, if you want to override the default messages for all schemas. This is in addition to being able to set `schema.messageBox` to your own custom `MessageBox` instance for a single schema, which you could already do. (thanks @clayne11)
- Labels with certain characters like single quotes will now show up correctly in validation error messages. (thanks @clayne11)
- `extend` is now chainable
- Requiredness validation now works for required fields that are in subschemas
- Fixed some issues with autoValues not being correctly added when they were deeply nested under several levels of arrays and objects.
